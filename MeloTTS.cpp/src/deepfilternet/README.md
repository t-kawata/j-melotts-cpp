# DeepFilterNet.cpp

[DeepFilterNet](https://github.com/Rikorose/DeepFilterNet) has been integrated with OpenVINO. This component filters noise in the int8 quantized model while ensuring performance is maintained. We currently support this feature only on Windows.

For more information about DeepFilterNet, please refer to [DeepFilterNet: A Low Complexity Speech Enhancement Framework for Full-Band Audio based on Deep Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05588).


Special thanks to Vincent Liu (vincent1.liu@intel.com) for incorporating this feature into MeloTTS.cpp.
