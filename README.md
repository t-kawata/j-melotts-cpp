# MeloTTS.cpp Japanese Support Research Repository

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to researching how to adapt **MeloTTS.cpp** for Japanese language support. The approach is to perform a strict, line-by-line comparison between the original **MeloTTS** codebase and **MeloTTS.cpp**. By doing so, we aim to identify which parts of the original MeloTTS need to be ported or translated into C++ for effective Japanese support in MeloTTS.cpp.

## Repository Structure

- **MeloTTS/**  
  Contains the complete source code of the original **MeloTTS** project, cloned directly from the official GitHub repository.

- **MeloTTS.cpp/**  
  Contains the complete source code of **MeloTTS.cpp**, also cloned from its official GitHub repository.

## Purpose

By comparing the two codebases, this repository helps clarify:
- Which components or features from the original MeloTTS are necessary for Japanese language compatibility.
- How to translate or port these components into C++ for use in MeloTTS.cpp.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Explore the `MeloTTS/` and `MeloTTS.cpp/` directories to examine the source codes.
3. Use the differences and similarities as a reference for porting or translating features, especially those related to Japanese language support.

## Note

- All source code in the `MeloTTS/` and `MeloTTS.cpp/` directories is cloned from their respective official GitHub repositories.
- This repository is for research and development purposes only.
